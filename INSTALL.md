# Installation instructions:

0. If you do not have `rlwrap`, run `sudo apt-get install rlwrap` to install it. If you plan on running the test suite, make sure `OUnit2` is installed by running `opam install ounit`.
1. Download and extract the zip file.
2. In terminal, run `make build`.
3. In terminal, run `make calc`. NOTE: If you are using WSL, there is a known issue with WSL being unable to properly render the fancy terminal being used. In this case, use the VSCODE integrated terminal.
4. Enjoy the calculator!

*Note: no additional commands should be required.*
